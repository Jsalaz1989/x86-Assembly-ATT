Introductory exercises into x86 assembly (AT&T syntax) taken from Programming from the Ground Up by Jonathan Bartlett. Each exercise is accompanied by .ppt slides created by me to help me visualize the stack, register values, and general process. Each .ppt has been checked for correctness with gdbgui.
